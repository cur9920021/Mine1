## üí° Pro Tips

### Automatic Features
- ‚úÖ Invoice numbers auto-increment (but you can edit)
- ‚úÖ Date defaults to today (but you can change)
- ‚úÖ Calculations update in real-time
- ‚úÖ Data saves automatically when you click "Save Invoice"
- ‚úÖ All data persists in browser (survives reloads)

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Tab**: Move between fields quickly

### Calculations Logic
```
Subtotal = Sum of (Quantity √ó Unit Price) for all items
Discount = Percentage or Fixed amount
After Discount = Subtotal - Discount
VAT = 14% of After Discount (if enabled)
Discount Tax = 1% of After Discount (if enabled, subtracted)
Transport = Additional shipping cost
Net Order = After Discount + VAT - Discount Tax + Transport
```

### Example Calculation
- Subtotal: **5000.00**
- Discount (10%): **-500.00**
- After Discount: **4500.00**
- VAT (14%): **+630.00**
- Discount Tax (1%): **-45.00**
- Transport: **+200.00**
- **Net Order: 5285.00 EGP**

## üé® Customization

### Change Company Info
Edit `app.js` lines 7-15:
```javascript
const COMPANY_INFO = {
    name: "Your Company Name",
    taxNumber: "Your Tax Number",
    address: "Your Address",
    phones: {
        mohamed_kamel: "Phone 1",
        mohamed_sobhy: "Phone 2"
    }
};
```

### Replace Logo
- Replace `logo.svg` with your own logo
- Recommended size: 180√ó80 pixels
- Formats: SVG, PNG, JPG

### Change Colors
Edit `styles.css`:
- Line 431: `background: #f0c674;` (yellow accent for headers)
- Line 803: `background: #f0c674;` (grand total highlight)

## üì± Mobile Usage

The app is fully responsive:
- Dashboard: Invoices stack vertically
- Form: Fields stack for easy input
- Invoice Preview: Scrolls horizontally if needed
- PDF: Always generates as A4 regardless of screen size

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### PDF Not Downloading
- **Solution**: Ensure you have internet connection (needs CDN for html2pdf.js)
- **Check**: Look for console errors (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
- **Try**: Use a local server instead of direct file:// protocol

### Data Disappeared
- **Cause**: Browser cache cleared or private browsing mode
- **Solution**: Use normal browsing mode, don't clear localStorage
- **Backup**: Export important invoices as PDFs regularly

### Logo Not Showing
- **Check**: Logo file is named `logo.svg` and in same folder as index.html
- **Try**: Use a PNG file instead (update filename in code)
- **Verify**: File path is correct (relative paths)

### Calculation Seems Wrong
- **Verify**: You understand the calculation order (see Pro Tips)
- **Check**: Discount Tax is SUBTRACTED (reduces total)
- **Remember**: Percentages apply to "After Discount" not original subtotal

### Invoice Number Already Exists
- **Cause**: Trying to use a duplicate invoice number
- **Solution**: Use the auto-generated number or choose a unique one
- **Note**: Invoice numbers must be unique across all invoices
