## 💡 Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to install anything?
**A:** No! Just open `index.html` in a browser. (Local server recommended for best PDF functionality)

### Q: Where is my data stored?
**A:** In your browser's localStorage. Data persists across sessions but is local to your browser.

### Q: Can multiple people use this?
**A:** Yes, but each person's data is stored separately on their own computer. For shared data, you'd need to add a backend database (future enhancement).

### Q: What if I clear my browser cache?
**A:** Invoice data would be lost. We recommend regularly exporting important invoices as PDFs for permanent backup.

### Q: Can I edit the PDF?
**A:** PDFs are generated as read-only documents. To make changes, edit the invoice in the system and download a new PDF.

### Q: Does this work offline?
**A:** Mostly yes! The app works offline, but PDF generation requires internet connection for the CDN library.

### Q: How do I backup my data?
**A:** Download PDFs regularly. For advanced users, you can export localStorage data from browser DevTools.

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Security Warning ⚠️
This is a client-side application. Data is stored in browser localStorage (unencrypted) and accessible to anyone with access to the browser. 

**For production use with sensitive data:**
- Add backend database
- Implement user authentication
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Use HTTPS
- Regular backups

**→ See [README.md](README.md) Security Notes section**

### Data Backup 💾
**Critical**: Browser data can be lost if cache is cleared. Always:
- Export important invoices as PDFs
- Keep PDFs organized in folders
- Consider implementing backend storage
