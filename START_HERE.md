## 🚨 Important Notes

### ⚠️ Before Production Use

4. Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console tab)

### Common Issues

**PDF not downloading?**
- Use a local server instead of opening file directly
- Check your internet connection (needs CDN)

**Logo not showing?**
- Verify the file is named exactly `logo.svg`
- Try using a PNG file instead

**Data disappeared?**
- Don't clear browser cache
- Export PDFs as backup

**Calculation seems wrong?**
