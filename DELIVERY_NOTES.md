## 🚨 Important Notes

### Before Production Use

**1. Replace Placeholder Logo** ⚠️
- Current `logo.svg` is a placeholder
- Replace with your actual company logo
- Recommended: 180×80 pixels, SVG or PNG format

**2. Update Company Information** ⚠️
- Edit `app.js` lines 7-15
- Update: name, tax number, address, phone numbers

**3. Test Thoroughly**
- Run through `TESTING.md` checklist
- Test on your target browsers
- Test on mobile devices
- Generate and review sample PDFs

**4. Consider Backend (Optional)** ℹ️
- Current system uses browser storage
- Data is NOT synced across devices
- Data can be lost if cache cleared
- For production with multiple users, consider:
  - Backend database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
  - User authentication
  - Cloud sync
  - Automated backups

### Security Considerations ⚠️

**Current Implementation** (client-side only):
- ⚠️ Data stored unencrypted in browser
- ⚠️ No user authentication
- ⚠️ No access control
- ⚠️ Data local to browser only

**Recommended for Production**:
- ✅ Backend API with database
- ✅ User authentication (JWT/OAuth)
- ✅ Data encryption at rest
- ✅ HTTPS for all traffic
- ✅ Regular automated backups
- ✅ Audit logging

**→ See [README.md](README.md) Security Notes for details**

### Data Backup Strategy 💾

**Critical**: Implement a backup strategy!

**Option 1** (Current System):
- Export important invoices as PDFs regularly
- Organize PDFs in dated folders
- PDFs are permanent and portable

**Option 2** (Advanced):
- Export localStorage data periodically
- Store JSON backup files
- Can be re-imported if needed

**Option 3** (Production):
- Implement backend database
- Automated database backups
- Cloud storage redundancy
