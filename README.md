### File Structure
```
align-invoice-app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main HTML structure
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css          # All styling and animations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.js              # Application logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logo.png            # Company logo (add this)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # This file
```

### Data Schema

Each invoice object contains:
```javascript
{
  id: string,                    // Unique identifier
  invoiceNumber: string,         // Invoice number
  invoiceDate: string,           // ISO date string
  accountNo: string,             // Optional account number
  client: {                      // Client information
    company, name, project, location, area,
    designer, contactPerson, contactNumber
  },
  items: [{                      // Array of invoice items
    code, type, name, color,
    quantity, unitPrice, lineTotal
  }],
  discount: {                    // Discount configuration
    type: 'none'|'percent'|'fixed',
    value: number
  },
  applyVAT: boolean,            // VAT 14% toggle
  applyDiscountTax: boolean,    // Discount tax 1% toggle
  transportCost: number,         // Shipping cost
  paymentTerms: string,          // Payment terms text
  notes: string,                 // Additional notes
  signature: string,             // Base64 image data
  totals: {                      // Calculated totals
    subtotal, discountAmount, afterDiscount,
    vatAmount, discountTaxAmount, transportCost, netOrder
  },
  createdAt: string,            // ISO timestamp
  updatedAt: string             // ISO timestamp
}
```

## Calculation Logic

### Subtotal
```
Subtotal = Œ£(Quantity √ó Unit Price) for all items
```

### Discount
```
If Percent: Discount Amount = Subtotal √ó (Discount % / 100)
If Fixed: Discount Amount = Discount Value
```

### After Discount
```
After Discount = Subtotal - Discount Amount
```

### VAT (if applied)
```
VAT Amount = After Discount √ó 0.14
```

### Discount Tax (if applied)
```
Discount Tax = After Discount √ó 0.01
(This is subtracted from the total)
```

### Net Order (Final Total)
```
Net Order = After Discount + VAT - Discount Tax + Transport
```

## PDF Generation

The PDF export uses the `html2pdf.js` library with the following configuration:
- **Format**: A4 (210mm √ó 297mm)
- **Orientation**: Portrait
- **Resolution**: 2x scale for crisp output
- **Quality**: 98% JPEG compression
- **CORS**: Enabled for image embedding
- **Filename**: Dynamic based on invoice number and client name

### Arabic Text Support
- Uses **Cairo** font family for Arabic characters
- Right-to-left (RTL) text direction support
- Font embedding in PDF for proper rendering

## Browser Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Chrome 90+
- ‚úÖ Firefox 88+
- ‚úÖ Safari 14+
- ‚úÖ Edge 90+

## Sample Invoice

The application includes a pre-seeded sample invoice with:
- **Invoice Number**: 000001
- **Client**: Modern Living Interiors (Sarah Ahmed)
- **Items**: 2 sample fabric/curtain items
- **Total**: EGP 8,697.40 (with 5% discount and VAT)

## Customization

### Company Information
Edit the `COMPANY_INFO` object in `app.js`:
```javascript
const COMPANY_INFO = {
    name: "Your Company Name",
    taxNumber: "Your Tax Number",
    address: "Your Address",
    phones: {
        mohamed_kamel: "Phone 1",
        mohamed_sobhy: "Phone 2"
    }
};
```

### Color Scheme
Modify CSS variables in `styles.css`:
- Primary: `#3498db`
- Success: `#27ae60`
- Danger: `#e74c3c`
- Warning: `#f39c12`
- Accent: `#f0c674` (yellow highlight)

### Invoice Layout
Adjust the `.invoice-document` styles in `styles.css` to modify spacing, fonts, and layout.

## Troubleshooting

### PDF Generation Issues
- **Images not appearing**: Ensure logo and signature images are properly loaded before generating PDF
- **Arabic text garbled**: Verify Cairo font is loaded from Google Fonts CDN
- **Large file size**: Reduce signature image size before upload

### Data Persistence
- **Invoices disappear**: Check browser localStorage settings
- **Cannot save**: Verify localStorage quota (usually 5-10MB)
- **Data corruption**: Clear localStorage and restart: `localStorage.clear()`

### Performance
- **Slow rendering**: Limit number of invoice items (recommended < 50 items)
- **Large dataset**: Consider implementing pagination for > 100 invoices

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This application stores data in browser localStorage:
- Data is NOT encrypted

- Data is NOT backed up
- Data can be lost if browser cache is cleared

For production use with sensitive data, implement:
- Backend database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)
- User authentication and authorization
- Data encryption at rest
- Regular backups
- HTTPS for all communications

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for future versions:
- [ ] Backend integration with database
- [ ] User authentication and multi-user support
- [ ] Email invoice delivery
- [ ] Multiple currency support
- [ ] Invoice templates
- [ ] Recurring invoices
- [ ] Payment tracking
- [ ] Analytics and reporting
- [ ] Multi-language interface
- [ ] Cloud backup and sync
